## How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I like to break things down into smaller steps and brainstorm about what needs to be achieved. I start by sketching or planning out the project and figuring out how different portion of the code will work together. I also think about how the final product will be easy for users to interact with.

- ## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  This project helped me get better at breaking complex scenes into simple objects. I learned how to combine shapes to build a detailed 3D scene, and I got more experience with how lighting affects objects which make shaped look more realistic.

- ## What design process did you follow for your project work?
  I started by understanding what was required for the project. Then I picked the objects and shapes that fit the scene, planned the layout, and built each part step by step. I focused on the way light and textures interacted with the objects and kept improving the scene through small changes.

- ## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  Breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps is a useful approach I can use in future projects. Also my practice of testing lighting and textures will help with other design related projects. Making early changes and testing often is another strategy I’ll use in the future.

## How do I approach developing programs?
When developing programs, I follow a clear plan or outline before I start coding. I work on small parts one at a time, making sure each piece part of code before moving to the next. This helps me catch mistakes early and keeps the program stable.

- ## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  For this project, I used a new strategy of creating custom functions for repetitive tasks. This made my code more organized and easier to work with. I also spent a lot of time experimenting with lighting setups to make the scene look realistic.

- ## How did iteration factor into your development?
  Iteration or repeating steps was a big part of my process. I would add a piece to the scene, test it and then go back to adjust things like size, texture, or lighting. Each time I made a change, I learned more about what worked, which helped me improve the final result.

- ## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
  Over time, I became more comfortable trying new things and making changes. At first, I focused on getting the project to work, but later I started thinking about how to make the code cleaner and more efficient. I also gained confidence in creating reusable functions and organizing my code better.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science gives me the tools to solve complex problems both logically and creatively. These skills are important for my goal of becoming a skilled programmer and designer. They can be used in many areas from software development to designing visual experiences.

- ## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  Learning about computational graphics has helped me think differently about visuals. I now know more about how to model 3D objects, use lighting, and add textures. These skills will be useful in future courses that involve design and presenting data in a visual way.

- ## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  In the professional world, understanding computational graphics and visualizations will help me create more engaging and visually appealing apps or products. Whether it’s in gaming or designing these skills will help me build products that are both functional and visually attractive. Being able to 
  create and work with 3D objects is also a unique skill that can be valuable in fields like product design or virtual environments.
